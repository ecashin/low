This is going to be a place for microbenchmarking counters that, once
read, are assumed to be possibly stale, but which were accurate at
some point in the past.

Mechanisms for testing:

  * mutex-coordinated increment of shared counter

  * lock prefix on add instruction (atomic increment) of shared
    counter

  * atomic increment of non-shared counters

  * regular increment of non-shared counters
